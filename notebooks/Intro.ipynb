    "\n",
    "I was asked to present an introduction to \"data\" and statistics. In two hours I am going to fail at anything comprehensive. Instead I will provide you with some things to look for, some issues that you'll come up against, and a little introduction to concepts that will help you read simple research papers. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, at the highest level, we have the unit of a data set. This is a collection of information about some phenomenon in the world. Data sets are social creatures and like to play with others, creating new data out of old through combination. Add your credit data to your web browsing behavior and we can serve you all manner of pointed ads. When you acquire a data set there are a few high-level questions you want to get right from the outset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Who collected these data?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why were they collected originally?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What methodology was used to assemble the information?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How have the data been used previously? And were the \"results\" published? Peer reviewed? Did they appear in a good journal or lead to some valuable insights?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Were the data made public under some kind of publication standard? Did they adhere to that standard and what burden does this place on your use? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What format are the data in? Are they a spreadsheet (CSV) or in XML or JSON? Is some speciality format used, and if so, do you have the software you need to analyze it?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Others?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from the kinds of efforts we are going to see today come in two broad categories - **observational or experimental**. As its name suggests, in an observational study we just record what we see. We talk to people or measure something, but we don't affect them in any other way. In an experimental setting, we introduce different \"treatments\" to see if groups differ based on the treatment they receive. Here you can think of A/B testing as a classic example - visitors to a web site are shown one of two headlines and the publication decides which is better by seeing if the click-through rate is higher for one over the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data and statistical analyses also serve different narrative ends. In the treatment that follows, think about the kinds of methods of data collection that are in play and the kinds of conclusions that can be drawn. The veracity of our statements depend on how the data were collected. Underlying all of this is whether or not you can say something reasonable about **the uncertinty in your data**, or about your conclusions. In some cases, it will be hard to quantify uncertainty and in others, especially those based on classic statistical designs like random sampling or random allocation, we can make very precise statements about uncertainty. Ultimately, this all gets at how knowledge is created from data.\n",

    "Rafa's chronology begins with the hurricane itself and President Trump's reaction. The death toll was quoted at 16. This struck Rafa as odd, as he was getting reports from home about electricity outages and the lack of clean water. The low death toll suggested that the local government was in control of the situation which, if incorrect, could put people at risk. Most of the text below comes from Rafa's blog post and my additions are in *italics*.\n",

    "**Oct 03** – The president of the USA visits Puerto Rico. In a press conference the governor states that the death count is 16.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    ">“Every death is a horror,” Trump said, “but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina and you look at the tremendous – hundreds and hundreds of people that died – and you look at what happened here with, really, a storm that was just totally overpowering … no one has ever seen anything like this.” “What is your death count?” he asked as he turned to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló. “17?” “16,” Rosselló answered. “16 people certified,” Trump said. “Sixteen people versus in the thousands. You can be very proud of all of your people and all of our people working together.\n",

The storm made landfall on Sept. 20. The government’s official death toll is 55...<br><br>\n",
    "At the news conference on Wednesday, Wanda Llovet, the director of Puerto Rico’s demographics registry, said more people died in September because so many young people had left the island, leaving Puerto Rico with an aging population.\n",

    "\n",
    "*I spoke with John Sutter and he said that CNN had a number of reporters on the ground and they started hearing from hospitals and funeral homes that there were a lot of people dying. Since the government was not producing data, where could they go? \"Funeral homes were the only ones with records, records that were not being processed quickly enough.\" The acquired a full list of funeral homes. They hired 5 freelancers and held a large training session in San Juan. They designed a questionnaire so that data collection was consistent - it included questions about their log of deaths, total numbers, number that they considered associated with the hurricane, why they thought that, specific examples, along with standard information like contact name/title/on record confirmation. In all, it took 2 weeks to create their own paper trail.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*In terms of evidence 112 or about half of the homes responded. In Sutter's words, their estimate was meant as a kind of \"gut check\" on the government's numbers. \"Did the number seem correct? Or was it an order of magnitude off?\" While carried out systematically, it is hard to do much more with this number. That is, it is hard to know what it's uncertainties might be. What could the other half of the funeral homes contribute? The funeral directors are not doctors and their determination of whether a death was storm-related was subjective. It is, as Sutter suggests, a gut check that could lead you to other analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nov 21** – The Penn State University (PSU) study with the first estimate of excess deaths based on mortality data is posted on SocArXiv They estimate about 1,000 excess deaths. This estimate is based on historical data from 2010-2016 and a count for September 2017 that the authors obtained from a public statement made by Puerto Rico’s Public Security Secretary.\n",

    "*Here is [a \"preprint\" of the paper that Rafa is referring to](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s7dmu/). Papers are frequently posted to sites like [arXiv](arXiv.org) who allow researchers to share papers before they've gone through peer review. arXiv, for example, posts to its site a \"Disclaimer: Papers will be entered in the listings in order of receipt on an impartial basis and appearance of a paper is not intended in any way to convey tacit approval of its assumptions, methods, or conclusions by any agent (electronic, mechanical, or other). We reserve the right to reject any inappropriate submissions.\" When working with expert material, it is important to understand its status. Has it been subjected to peer review?

Web pages are written in HTML and are designed for display in web browsers. PDF (the Portable Document Format) is really good for representing data to a printer -- creating a standard like this was a huge deal when PDF was introduced. Often, however, it becomes a vehicle for publishing data and then you start to see its weaknesses. Extracting data from a PDF will depend, first, on the kind of PDF it is. If you can \"select\" text from the document, you're in luck. There are several tools to help you get reasonably close to the data. If, on the other hand, your pages are essentially images, well, then you have to rely on \"optical character recognition\" programs that cluster black and white pixels, say, into letters and words and sentences.* \n",

You can read more about the format [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values). For those of you more familiar with a spreadshet program, a CSV will always open.*\n",
